# How To Create A Monitoring Session #

First make sure you have the following information
  * Your Full ApiKey
  * Your UserID
  * The name of your character who has the POS's

You can get you ApiKey and UserID from http://www.eveonline.com/api.

**Note:** _None of the displayed API details here are real, I made them up._

The next step is to create a new monitoring session by selecting "New Monitor" from the "File" menu. This can be seen in the picture below.

Next you are asked for you full ApiKey, which needs to be pasted into the box provided, if you want to cancel this process just select "Cancel". See the picture below for an illustration.

Next you are asked for your UserID, which needs to be pasted into the box provided, if you want to cancel this process just select "Cancel". See the picture below for an illustration.

Next you will be prompted to enter the name of your Character, who has the POS you wish to monitor. See the picture below for an illustration.

After these steps, you will then be prompted with a window where you must select the POS you wish to monitor. Unfortunately in this version of the software you have to enter in the Moon ID of the POS you wish to monitor. See the picture below for an illustration.

If for any reason the software cannot find any POS's the prompt displays the following, as it has not been setup to alert you if there are no POS's to monitor. See the picture below for an illustration.

If you had a POS to select and typed in the MoonID correctly you will then get the final monitoring window. See the picture below for an illustration.
